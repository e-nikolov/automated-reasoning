We need to add the following line on top of the smt2 code generated by z3's to_smt2() in order to make it work in yices and z3's smt2 solver:

http://yices.csl.sri.com/doc/smt-logics.html
Reals:
(set-logic QF_UFLRA)

Ints:
(set-logic QF_UFNIA) non-linear
(set-logic QF_UFLIA) linear

prittles <= 20 -> sat
prittles == 21 -> doesn't converge
prittles == 22 -> doesn't converge
prittles >= 23 -> unsat
